# California Housing Prices: Linear Model

## Problem Statement

Predicting house prices in California is an important taks for understanding the real estate market. It s beneficial for buyers, sellers, and policymakers for better decission. This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate the house price in California based on features like house age, income, distance from the ocean and etc. abs

The goal is to use two approach:
- `Using Scikit-learn's Linear Regression`: Train a machine learning model to learn patterns form the data and predict house prices.
- `Using Regression Formula`: Manually compute the prediction using the normal equation for linear regresison to verify the results.

Finally, we will compare and evaluate the performance of both methods to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Goal

The objective of this project is to provide an understanding and practical implementation of linear regression in machine learning. It will cover key concepts such as matrix multiplication, the least squares method, and more. By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience with using scikit-learn's linear regression module, as well as writing custom code to calculate linear regression manually.
